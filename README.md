Here you find a new panel *Payment Methods* to configure the payment methods for the customer group:

* **Disable default methods:** If set to *Yes*, this disables all payment methods that are enabled in the system configuration and only leaves following configured methods available.
* **Available Methods:** Defines the methods that should be available for the customer group.
   * If *Disable default methods* is set to *Yes* **only** this methods are available, otherwise the selected methods are additionaly available to the methods enabled in the system configuration
   * **IMPORTANT:** All methods that are selected here **must** be configured in the system configuration, but it has to be **disabled** in system configuration if it should only be available for specific customer groups.
